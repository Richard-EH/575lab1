		<div id="title">Virginia Population Shifts 2010-2020!<br> An Examination of Population Shifts in 38 Independent Cities located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. </div>
		<div id="author"> Created by Richard Helsley for GEO 575 Lab 1.</div>

			<div id="caption">Map of Population shifts in VA Cities. Data Collected from US Census and the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.<br>
			While the data is present I have been unable to unlock the Javascript secret in order to make it work as assigned in the lab. </div>

		<div id="Main_Content"><p>We have all heard how populations are shifting and it not only affects society, but also our environment itself. There is however more to the story.
			The story changes when you look further at the data, while larger Urban Areas are growing in size and population density there are smaller Urban Areas, such as those
			located in rural Virginia, in counties that already have a low population. Those cities are either remaining stagnant or in some cases shrinking. If you'll notice in 
			the data the areas in more rural areas have a greatly reduced growth if any. There could be a multitude of reasons for this, and while those reasons are beyond the scope 
			of this project I believe they would be of great interest to those examining this data.</p> <br>
			<p>According to the US Census estiamtes approximately 40% of the current population exists in less than 5% of Urban Areas. This highlights that amoung other things clearly
			not all Urban Areas are created equal. Granted the year 2020 and 2021 have been affected by the current Pandemic people have continued to move. Part of this move is easily
			put forth due to economoic concerns. Specifically, larger cities and the surrounding areas have much greater opportunity economically speaking than that of say small cities and rural areas.
			While small family farms are still the biggest part of agriculture, the value of their production efforts were barely over half of the that of large corporate farms. However, with
			the Pandemic changing how and where Americans work may have an interesting effect of current migration trends within the US.</p>
